2.0.0 Released!
===============

This is the first stable release for Ergonomica! To clear a couple of things up:


You Probably Shouldn't Use This As Your Main Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ergonomica is an experimental shell, and as such it doesn't have near the features or support that Fish, Zsh, or Bash have. As such, you'll probably need to use another shell often. However, feel free to use it as long as it's convenient and (please) build extensions for it!

Why 2.0.0? What about 1.0.0?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ergonomica's early, early alpha (3 total rewrites before 2.0.0) was pushed to PyPI as 1.0.0, and the next versions were This version was very unusable and highly unstable. Then, since the rewrite made incompatible API changes, it was changed to 2.0.0-alpha.1, and PyPI versions cant be changed, etc... 2.0.0 is what fits with all Git commit history and thus it is what was chosen.
